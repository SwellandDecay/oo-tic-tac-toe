# #display_board
# Define a method that prints the current board representation based on the @board instance variable.

    def display_board
        puts " #{@board[0]} | #{@board[1]} | #{@board[2]} "
        puts "-----------"

# #input_to_index
# Define a method into which we can pass user input (in the form of a string, e.g., "1", "5", etc.) and have it return to us the corresponding index of the @board array. Remember that, from the player's point of view, the board contains spaces 1-9. But the indices in an array start their count at 0. If the user inputs 5, your method must correctly translate that from the player's perspective to the array's â€” accounting for the fact that @board[5] is not where the user intended to place their token.

    def input_to_index(input)
        index = input.to_i - 1
    end

# #move
# Your #move method must take in two arguments: the index in the @board array that the player chooses and the player's token 
# (either "X" or "O"). The second argument, the player's token, should default to "X".

    def move(index, token="X")

        @board[index] = token

    end

# #position_taken?
# 
# The #position_taken? method will be responsible for evaluating the user's desired move against the Tic Tac Toe board 
# and checking to see whether or not that position is already occupied. 
# Note that this method will be running after #input_to_index, so it will be checking index values. 
# When it is passed the index value for a prospective move, #position_taken? will check to see if that position on the @board is vacant 
# or if it contains an "X" or an "O". If the position is free, the method should return false (i.e., "the position is not taken"); 
# otherwise, it will return true.

    def position_taken?(index)

        @board[index] == " " ? false : true

    end

# #valid_move?
# Build a method valid_move? that accepts a position to check and returns true if the move is valid and false or nil if not. 
# A valid move means that the submitted position is:
# Present on the game board.
# Not already filled with a token.

    def valid_move?(index)

        !self.position_taken?(index) && index < 9 && index >= 0 ? true : false

    end

# #turn
# 
# Build a method #turn to encapsulate the logic of a single complete turn composed of the following routine:
#
# Ask the user for their move by specifying a position between 1-9.
# Receive the user's input.
# Translate that input into an index value.
# If the move is valid, make the move and display the board.
# If the move is invalid, ask for a new move until a valid move is received.
# All these procedures will be wrapped into our #turn method. 
# However, the majority of the logic for these procedures will be defined and encapsulated in individual methods that you've already 
# built.
#
# You can imagine the pseudocode for the #turn method:
#
# ask for input
# get input
# translate input into index
# if index is valid
#   make the move for index
#   show the board
# else
#   ask for input again
# end 
# #turn_count
# This method returns the number of turns that have been played based on the @board variable.
